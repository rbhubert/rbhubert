## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm RocÃ­o, a passionate data scientist :sparkles: I have developed data-driven applications and possess hands-on expertise in prompt engineering, data mining, machine learning model development, data visualization, and reporting of analysis and results. 

:computer: I enjoy working on side projects related to data science, always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge!

:book:  I love storytelling in all its forms â€”books, movies, TV shows, games, or mangaâ€”, but I've got a soft spot for horror :jack_o_lantern:
